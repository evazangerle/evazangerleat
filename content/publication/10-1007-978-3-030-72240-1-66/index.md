abstract: The paper gives a brief overview of the three shared tasks to be organized
  at the PAN 2021 lab on digital text forensics and stylometry hosted at the CLEF
  conference. The tasks include authorship verification across domains, author profiling
  for hate speech spreaders, and style change detection for multi-author documents.
  In part the tasks are new and in part they continue and advance past shared tasks,
  with the overall goal of advancing the state of the art, providing for an objective
  evaluation on newly developed benchmark datasets.
